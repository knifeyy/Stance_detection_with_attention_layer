# Stance_detection_with_attention_layer
Attempted to develop a single, end to end stance detection system that consists of lexical and similarity features passed through a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with one hidden layer. Further, have incorporated attention vectors in the initial layers and compared results of both models.
